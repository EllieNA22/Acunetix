Enter the URL of the web application you wish to scan.
Provide additional details such as the application name and description if needed.
Configure Scan Settings:

Choose between a full scan or a specific scan type (e.g., High-Risk Vulnerabilities).
Configure options such as scan depth, authentication, and additional scan settings based on your needs.
Run the Scan:

Once you have configured the scan settings, click "Start Scan."
Acunetix will begin scanning the specified URL for vulnerabilities, and you can monitor the progress in real-time.

Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
Run ipconfig Command:

Look for the "IPv4 Address" under your active network connection. This is the IP address of your machine.
Configuring Scans for Internal Servers
Add Internal Server as a Target:

Go to the "Targets" section in Acunetix and click "Add Target."
Enter the IP address of the internal server you want to scan. You can find this IP address using the ipconfig command as described above.
Configure Scan Settings:

Select the scan type (e.g., Full Scan, High-Risk Vulnerabilities) for your internal server.
Configure additional settings such as port scanning, network services, and authentication if required.
Run the Scan:

After configuring the scan, click "Start Scan."
Acunetix will begin scanning the internal server for vulnerabilities, just as it would with a web application.

4. Viewing and Understanding Reports
Accessing Scan Results
View Completed Scans:

Once the scan is complete, go to the "Scans" section under your target.
Select the completed scan to view detailed results.
